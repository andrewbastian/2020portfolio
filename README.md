# Portfolio site:

A simple portfolio website built with:

- [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/)

- [Adobe's React Spectrum](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum)

- [React-Tiny-Links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tiny-link)

This site also features a loading page created in Adobe After Effects and custom SVG logos created in Illustrator:

The large GIF for the loading page has been added to the repository with `Git Large File Storage`

![Linkedin Logo](https://github.com/andrewbastian/2020portfolio/blob/master/src/assets/unused/linkedin-logo-black.gif "Linkedin Logo")

I also took the photo used for the background image.

In the future, I plan to add a contact form to the page and a link to my resume.
